We will be looking at patients who have arterial and venous blood gases obtained very close to each other. This will provide an estimate of how much oxygen is extracted by the tissues from the arterial blood and how much carbon dioxide is dumped into the venous blood. These are proxies for cellular metabolism during critical illness.

Variables to obtain:

Couplets of central venous and arterial blood gases within 1 hour, excluding if there are: Intubation between collection 

Central venous saturation (on blood gas)

Lactate levels within 4 hours pre and post collection

Vasopressors and inotropes including doses

Central line presence, and location

    PICC line, internal jugular, subclavian acceptable

    Femoral central line?
